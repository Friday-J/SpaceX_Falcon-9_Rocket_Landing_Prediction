As part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Program, I will assume the role of a Data Scientist working for a startup (SpaceY) aiming to outwit a rival rocket launching company SpaceX. SpaceX launches it's Falcon 9 rocket but not all the landings are successful.

My responsibility is to perform exploratory data analysis and spatial analysis as well as machine learning models to predicting if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. This would reduce the cost of operation and attract the customers to our company.
